                                               NETWORKING

     It's a connection of network at a global scale .

                                          HOW INTERNET START-

 Once there is cold war happen between United state and Soviet Union .
 The war for who came first in Refernence of launch first satelite or in any field .

 So , As a result Russian won and he Lunch Satelite name sputnik

 In The answer of that United States - created a program ARPA [ advanced Research Project Agency ]

                                                  ARPA PROBLEM -

The Comes that building of ARPA are in a Various part . Like they setup computer on four places - [ MIT , starford, VCLA , uta ] , Due to which it little bit harder to Commnucate to each of them .
Its take lot of time and resource to commnucate them .

                   PROBLEM SOLVE

To solve this Problem They developed ARPANET { SO THEY COMMNUCATE EACH OTHER }.
THEY USE TCP { TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCAL } for the Commnucation .

                  PROBLEM OCCURS -  
Autmoted shareing was missing .

THEY have TCP for this
PROTOCALS - RULE AND RAGULATION SETUP BY PEOPLE .

FOR SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF AUTOMATED SHAREING -

now for this Come WWW { tim berner }

www is a project that store these document .
{ allow access of all these document and automated shareing was happening }

BUT WE HAVE NO SEARCH ENGINE TO SEARCH ANY -
So the first search engine was developed for the Search .

        PROTOCALS -

Protocal rule and regulation created by INTERNET SOCIETY.

HOW IT WORK -

COMPUTER -> request -> SERVER
responce <-

BASIC PROTOCALS -

Basic protocals we use in Networking -

TCP - > ( Transmisition control protocals insure that data will reach on distination and not be in crupted format )

UDP - > ( Not all data will reaches but what required ) ( user datagram protocal)
Exmaple - Video call .

HTTP - > format of the data that transer between client and server .

                        ISP { Internet Service provider }

ISP -> router/ moder ( global ip address) -> seperated ip address ( d1 ..)( DHCP)
which device call requested determineby NAP

               ISP
                !                (Its has a  GLOBAL IP ADDRESS)
        (router / Moder)
            !    !   !          ( SEPERATED IP ADDRESS)
      device (1   2    3)

HOW FIND WHICH DEVICE CALL A REQUEST ?
For Determine this we use NAP

WHAT IS IP/PORT Adress .

Ip address identify computer
port number identify application
port number is 16 bit 2\*16 = 65000

SOME PORT NUMBER ARE ALREADY DEFINE -

HTTP -> port 80 { 0-1023} { reserved port }

Mongodb ->port 27017 {1024 -49152}
SQl -> port 1433

REMAINING YOU CAN USE

HOW COMMNUCATION HAPPEN -

COMMNUCATION HAPPEN IN A TWO WAY -

GUIDED WAY -
In Guided way Set of path already define.
EXAMPLE - wire

UNGUIDED way
In unguided way Set of path is Not define .
Example wifi ,blutooth .

SUBMARINE CABLE -

They have Seperated across ocen from one country to another .

How we gain Access of ISP .

                India
                  !
         who manage this
                  !
          → smaller entity
                  !
          - > ISP ( bSnl , airtle , ..)
                  !
           give us )

LETS talk About some NETWORK THAT WE HERE BEFORE

LAN - local area network
metropolitan area Network - ( across citiese)
Wide area Network ( across country)(optical fiber cable)

Internet is collection LAN-> MAN- > WAN

WAN -
SONET - > caried data using fiber cable so its cover larget area
Frame Realay - > way to connect local area to wider area .

MODEM - >
USe to convert digital signal to analog Signal ( electrical signal )
Router - >
routes the data package

TOPOLOGIES -
BUS -> EVERY system connected to each other nin a seriese .
RING → Computer connected in a ring
STAR → One central device connected to all computer .
TREE → Combinaton of bus and star
MESH → Every Single computer connected to every Single computer
